1. what is Git Hooks?

***Git hooks are simple scripts that run before or after certain actions. 
They are useful for a variety of tasks, but primarily I find them useful for client-side validation so simple mistakes can be prevented. 
For example, you can test syntax on files being commited, you can even have tests run.




Derived objects:-
Derived objects are files (intermediate or not) that are not directly maintained, but get created. 
The most typical context is that of compilation, linking, and packaging of source files.

Pre-Commit:-
----------

The pre-commit script is executed every time you run git commit before Git asks the developer for a commit message or generates a commit object. You can use this hook to inspect the snapshot that is about to be committed. For example, you may want to run some automated tests that make sure the commit doesn’t break any existing functionality.

npm install:-
-----------
npm is a NodeJS package manager. As its name would imply, you can use it to install node programs. Also, if you use it in development, it makes it easier to specify and link dependencies
